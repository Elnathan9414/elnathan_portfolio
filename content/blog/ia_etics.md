In the world of data science, data is often referred to as the "new oil." It’s a valuable resource that, when refined correctly, can power insightful decisions, streamline operations, and illuminate paths previously hidden in the dark. But like oil, if not handled carefully, it can also create a toxic spill, one that damages an organization’s reputation and erodes the trust of the very people it serves.

Recently, I was presented with a scenario that perfectly encapsulates the delicate ethical tightrope data professionals walk every day. An organization, eager to improve its educational offerings, deployed a course evaluation survey. The goal was noble: executive management wanted to identify which courses needed redesign or updating. However, the path to this goal was paved with good intentions that create a significant ethical quagmire. As the data analyst tasked with deriving insights from this survey, I am immediately confronted with several red flags that must be addressed before a single data point is analyzed.

This post will dissect this scenario, exploring the ethical issues at play and outlining a path forward that respects both the participants and the organization's need for actionable data.
